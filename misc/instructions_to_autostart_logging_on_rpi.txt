These instructions will enable automatic AFR logging with a raspberry pi mounted to the motorcycle and connected to the AFR logger

1. Setup a standard raspberry pi with SSH access
2. Use the pi as hotspot by following instructions on https://www.raspberrypi.com/tutorials/host-a-hotel-wifi-hotspot/ , excluding "Configure connection portal"
3. Log into the pi using an application like MobaXterm for SSH and upload 
\software\afr_logger\log_afr_to_disk.py 
\software\afr_logger\log_launcher.sh

to the home folder. Make sure to update any filepaths in the files to match home directory of the device you are using. 
Make sure the line endings are in Unix format, which can be double-checked using notepad++ on windows (Edit>EOL Conversions) or nano on the raspberry pi (write-out, if 'DOS conversion' shows up press ALT+D to disable it and write in unix format instead).
4. execute 
"chmod +x log_afr_to_disk.py" 
"chmod +x log_launcher.sh" 
to make it executable

5. To verify everything works, connect he AFR-logger connected on USB, then execute
"mkdir afrlogs"
"mkdir logs"
"./log_launcher.sh"

output should be 
Writing to log afrlogs/afr_log1.log

6. Follow instructions on https://www.instructables.com/Raspberry-Pi-Launch-Python-script-on-startup/ to add this launcher to the files executed on startup of the pi - execute:
"sudo crontab -e"
Select nano
Enter line "@reboot sh /home/joop/log_launcher.sh >/home/joop/logs/cronlog 2>&1"
writeout and exit

7. Reboot (with afr-logger still connected), back in and check if new logs are being written:
"sudo reboot"
log back in
check errors: "cat /logs/cronlog"
check if logging: 
"ls -l ~/afrlogs/" (check last filename)
"cat ~/afrlogs/afr_logXXX.log"
